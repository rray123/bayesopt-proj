# bayesopt-proj

This folder contains the code/notebooks to reproduce the plots in the project report. Note the following:
1. A virtual environment is needed to run the notebooks.
2. The notebooks will not reproduce all simulations due to runtime considerations. .csv files with previously run results are included to reproduce the plots.
