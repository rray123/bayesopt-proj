# bayesopt-proj

This folder contains the code/notebooks to reproduce the plots in the project report. Note the following:
1. A virtual environment is needed to run the notebooks.
2. The notebooks will not reproduce all simulations due to runtime considerations. .csv files with previously run results are included to reproduce the plots.

Within the folder, here are the relevant notebooks
1. functions.ipnyb contains all implementations
2. paper_code.ipnym contains example code to run simulations
3. plots.ipnym contains plotting code to reproduce the figures from the .csv files (produced from previous simulation runs)
